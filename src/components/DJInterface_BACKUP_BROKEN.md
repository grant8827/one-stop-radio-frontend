// This was a backup of the corrupted DJInterface.tsx file - kept for reference
// The file became corrupted during a failed playlist removal attempt
// Original issue: Had two playlist implementations, attempted to remove one
// Result: JSX structure became broken with incomplete elements and duplicate content blocks
